# Image Style Transfer Using CNNs

This is a Pytorch implementation of Gatys et al.'s [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf).

The file for pre-trained model parameters is borrowed from Gatys's own repo on the same topic [here](https://github.com/leongatys/PytorchNeuralStyleTransfer), and  can be downloaded by running:
```
wget -c --no-check-certificate https://bethgelab.org/media/uploads/pytorch_models/vgg_conv.pth
